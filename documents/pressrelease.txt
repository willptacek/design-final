online gallery is an entirely virtual gallery designed to replicate the classical experience.

the experience is intended to be as minimal and barebones as possible, as one would expect in a brick and mortar art gallery.
inside of an actual gallery, one expects nothing else than 4 white walls, a desk, a chair, and the art.  
the physical design of the modern gallery space has been refined into this minimal product

online gallery tries to replicate this extremely basic design by using extremely basic web design, also known as brutalist web design.
we use the standard html font, courier new, with minimal styling on our components. 
visually, the only non black and white elements of the gallery are the paintings themselves.
the titles of the paintings are the file names used to reference them in the code, showing that they are just images.

we have enter and leave buttons to simulate entering and leaving a physical space.
this press release is only available on the home page; the reader can only access it after or before viewing the paintings so as not to distract them.
presented as text files with minimal formatting, the standard checklist/press release is also barebones and brutalist to let the site itself to the talking.

primarily, this is designed for me, will ptacek, to have full control of a gallery show without having to invest any money in an actual space.
